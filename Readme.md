Number Logics - Java Programs

This repository contains Java programs that cover fundamental number-based logic problems. These programs are designed for beginners who want to strengthen their Java programming skills through simple problem-solving.

Program Descriptions

1. Number Comparison

Greatn2.java → Determines the greater of two numbers using conditional statements.

Greatn3.java → Finds the greatest number among three numbers using nested conditionals.

2. Number Properties

Palindrome.java → Checks whether a given number or string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).

Primenum.java → Determines if a number is a prime number (a number greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself).

evodd.java → Identifies whether a number is even or odd using the modulus operator.

posneg.java → Checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

leapyear.java → Determines whether a given year is a leap year (divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400).

3. Mathematical Operations

area.java → Computes the area of geometric shapes like circles, squares, and rectangles based on user input.

simpleinterest.java → Calculates simple interest using the formula: SI = (P × R × T) / 100.

fibonnaci.java → Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.

reversenum.java → Reverses the digits of an input number.

sumn.java → Computes the sum of the first N natural numbers using loops.


Usage Instructions

Ensure Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on your system.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the Java files.

Compile and run the programs using the following commands:
